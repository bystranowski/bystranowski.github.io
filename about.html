      <h1>About me</h1>

      <p>
        I'm primarily a <strong>legal scholar</strong>. My doctoral dissertation
        was devoted to

          >proxy crimes</a
        >, an often-overlooked category of criminal offences, which I analysed
        from several perspectives: legal doctrine, moral philosophy, economic
        analysis of law, and experimental jurisprudence. My other main areas of
        interest in law are

          >.”</em
        >
        I've been fortunate to work with a team of talented young scholars, with
        whom we are trying to probe people's intuitions about questions such as:
        What does it mean to be ignorant of law? What epistemic duties regarding
        law are there? How is ignorance of law different from ignorance of other
        social norms, or from ignorance of facts? Check
        <a
          href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/383562797_Ignorance_of_law_does_not_excuse_A_new_empirical_account"

          class="text-link"
          rel="noopener"
          >this manuscript</a
        >
        for a representative sample of our research.
      </p>
      <p>
        Studying ignorance of the law has led me to broader questions in
        <strong>legal and social cognition</strong>. How do people recognise
        that a situation is governed by social rules? How do they reconstruct
        those rules from scattered environmental cues? And when do they decide
        it is worth investing effort to investigate potential norms? I aim to
        explore these questions through behavioural experiments.
      </p>
      <p>
        Much of my research belongs to

        >: employing experimental methods of social sciences to generate
        insights useful for legal theory. I'm very fond of the experimental
        jurisprudence community and grateful for the support I've received from
        many of its leading members. In return, I aspire to expand the field's
        methodological repertoire. While vignette surveys remain dominant, I
        believe other tools—such as behavioural, multi-player experiments—can
        better capture the fundamentally social character of law.
